I walk in this bitch, I'm lookin' like a light bulb
Give me 30 thousand to walk in your night club
And I switch my shoes and shit like I'm from Flight Club
I got drugs, is you gon' use 'em? Bitch, I don't like nice girls
Uh, uh, go on, get bugged
Uh, they play the song at the club, go on, get bugged
And I'm a thug, the hoes like us
Come party with the gang-gang, you gon' have fun

Uh, big G Herbo, call me Swervo
Fuck that humble shit, hit the turbo
You can't even book me for nothin' less than 30
But 20 or somethin', that's what you get a verse for
I was drinkin' lean on niggas first
Foenem got me poppin' Percs, though
.380 Glock, ho, put that in your purse
Prolly go on a lil' chase for the worst, though
Chill, though, you thirsty as fuck
I can't fuck with groupie bitches, I'ma keep it a buck
Gotta keep it 150, got a light dub or a 50 with me
Pull to the club for the backend, keep that shit if you frisk me
Already goin' up in this bitch, it's risky
Ah-ha, foenem lose control up in this bitch like Missy
And you ain't never say they miss me
Lord, fuck it, I'ma spend a rack and bulletproof the Bentley truck
Matter fact, that ain't even gonna be tough, I'm 'bout to get some money

I walk in this bitch, I'm lookin' like a light bulb
Give me 30 thousand to walk in your night club
And I switch my shoes and shit like I'm from Flight Club
I got drugs, is you gon' use 'em? Bitch, I don't like nice girls
Uh, uh, go on, get bugged
Uh, they play the song at the club, go on, get bugged
And I'm a thug, the hoes like us
Come party with the gang-gang, you gon' have fun

I might pull up with your bop, I got her off the drugs
Drop out of school, I always ditched to go hang with the thugs
Exotic pack, this ain't just weed what I put in my lungs
Hollow points the only shells what I want in my guns
Fold up lil' crew 'cause both a real loose screwy (I am)
Fuck the opps, sit back and roll their homies out the QT
I been stackin', miss my niggas, this one for Lil Boosie
Come have fun with the gang, we turn shit to a movie
All these bitches groupies, I might buy some uzis
Pass 'em to the gang-gang, niggas smoked like loosies
Niggas get fucked like coochie, we rob niggas for they oochies
Treat a penny nigga like Rudy's, most of these niggas is goofies, gang

I walk in this bitch, I'm lookin' like a light bulb
Give me 30 thousand to walk in your night club
And I switch my shoes and shit like I'm from Flight Club
I got drugs, is you gon' use 'em? Bitch, I don't like nice girls
Uh, uh, go on, get bugged
Uh, they play the song at the club, go on, get bugged
And I'm a thug, the hoes like us
Come party with the gang-gang, you gon' have fun

Ayy, hey, where you from?
Who told you come around this way? Bitch, is you dumb?
This drip so slimy, murder one
Gang on gangsta shit, 150 in the slums
Ayy, serve what you want because we on the same thing
You a walkin' lick if you ain't with the stain gang
My brother fucked a ho down with your main thing
Fuck nigga, rocks in the jewels, let the chain swing
Wettin' the blocks broad day, nigga, dang rain
Bendin' the block, yellin', "Gang, gang, gang, gang"
Run from cops and they know we won't say names
Pick up the Glocks, milly rock-a-bye, bang-bang
Play by the rules, a'ight?
Walk-walk away, don't make the news, a'ight?
I might go drop on a Tuesday night
Diamonds dancin', thought you could use the light, yeah
You gotta wait 'til it's payday
Bank cash my check in the same day
You tryna see what your bae say
My niggas solid, bro coolin', that's my ese

I walk in this bitch, I'm lookin' like a light bulb
Give me 30 thousand to walk in your night club, uh
And I switch my shoes and shit like I'm from Flight Club
I got drugs, is you gon' use 'em? Bitch, I don't like nice girls
Uh, uh, go on, get bugged
Uh, they play the song at the club, go on and bug
And I'm a thug, the hoes like us
Come party with the gang-gang, you gon' have fun
